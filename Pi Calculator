'''
there are many approximations to pi in the form of fractions. 
although not everyone can use a power series representation or a ramanujan
calculation for pi, this program demonstrates how simple for loops in 
python can help determine certain values close to pi

#setting a constant, pi

accuracy = int(input("How accurate would you like this fraction representation of pi to be? (Enter number of digits): "))

#using numbers up to 1000, anything more and my PC started to crash

for i in range(1000, 1, -1):

      print("pi, to {} decimals is approximately equal to {}.".format(accuracy, i/x))
